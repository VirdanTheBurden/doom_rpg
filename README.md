# DOOM, The RPG (No, not the one from 2005)

You ever just want to murder demons casually? I mean, I do. But sometimes, I can't crack open a can of rage and play DOOM II, or the first one for that matter. Not because I don't want to, but because I don't have the ability to (I'm running off a Chromebook lmfao).

So to get some sense of demon killing action, I've decided to create an RPG based off of DOOM in Python. Here's what's in the game, or planned for it.

## Weaponry and Armor
### No Glory Kills here, just pure manly gun blastin'.

All your essential weapons, armor, and powerups from the classic games are here, along with a few unique ones from some of the later titles.

From DOOM (1993)
* Fist - the closest thing to a glory kill you'll get
* Chainsaw - fist, but faster
* Pistol - your first friend
* Combat Shotgun - your workhorse weapon, treat her nicely
* Chaingun - *intense flashbacks to DOOM II Chaingunners*
* Plasma Rifle - or is it gun? the world may never know
* Rocket Launcher - because no 90s game is complete without explosives
* BFG - Arch-vile's Bane
* "Green" Security Armor - yeah, "very secure" these DOOM maps are
* "Blue" Mega Armor - for when you want to cosplay as Megaman
* Beserk, Invulnerability, Partial Invisibility - one of these is not like the others

From DOOM II
* Super Shotgun - the 100 RNG call gun

From DOOM 64
* Unmaker - also spelt *Unmaykr*

From 2016/Eternal
* Gauss Cannon / Ballista - no siege mode to save you now (sorry)
